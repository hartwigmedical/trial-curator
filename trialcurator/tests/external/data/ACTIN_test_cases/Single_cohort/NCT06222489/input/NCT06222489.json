      "briefSummary": "Activity of patritumab deruxtecan (U3-1402; HER3-DXd) has been shown in a phase I/II study in patients with HER3 expressing breast cancer as well as in a phase I study in patients with EGFR TKI refractory EGFR mutation positive NSCLC with a preliminary ORR of 25%. HER3 expression can be seen in multiple tumor types and is therefore an attractive target for antibody drug conjugate (ADC) treatment. However, intra- and intertumor heterogeneity of HER3 expression might be substantial, as is seen for HER2, and might contribute to treatment failure or heterogeneous responses. In addition, HER3 expression is dynamic and has been shown to change over time.\n\nIn order to identify patients that may benefit most from treatment with patritumab deruxtecan, better knowledge of the in vivo behaviour of the drug is warranted. One way to visualize this behaviour is positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radiolabelled antibodies (immune-PET). 89Zr-Patritumab deruxtecan PET/CT can assess HER3 expression non-invasively at a whole body level, including sites that may be difficult to biopsy. It also visualizes and quantifies biodistribution of patritumab deruxtecan, thereby obtaining valuable information for safety and toxicity analyses."
