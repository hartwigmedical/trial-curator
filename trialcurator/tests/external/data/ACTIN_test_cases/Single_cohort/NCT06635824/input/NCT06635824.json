      "briefSummary": "This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, international, Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acasunlimab in combination with pembrolizumab versus docetaxel (standard of care) in participants with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have been treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy, administered either in combination or sequentially in the metastatic setting.",
      "detailedDescription": "The goal of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of acasunlimab (an experimental antibody also known as GEN1046 or DuoBody\u00ae PDL1x4-1BB) in combination with pembrolizumab (an antibody known as KEYTRUDA\u00ae) compared to that of docetaxel (a standard of care chemotherapy). During the trial, the participant's quality of life will also be evaluated using industry-standard scales of measurement. To be eligible, participants:\n\n1. must have lung cancer that has metastasized (spread)\n2. have tumors that are positive for the PD-L1 protein (a biomarker that may be predictive of response to therapy)\n3. will have been previously treated with a PD-1/PD-L1-inhibitor and a platinum-containing cancer therapy administered in combination or sequentially.\n\nOther eligibility criteria will also apply.\n\nParticipants will be assigned to 1 of 2 active therapies, also known as treatment arms, as follows:\n\n* Acasunlimab (100 mg) and pembrolizumab (400 mg) once every 6 weeks (Q6W), or\n* Docetaxel 75 mg/m\\^2 once every 3 weeks (Q3W).\n\nThe estimated trial duration for a participant will vary but may be up to 5 years, consisting of:\n\n* An optional 56-day pre-screening period\n* A 28-day screening period\n* Up to 2 years of treatment\n* A 90-day safety follow-up period\n* Post-treatment follow-up."
