      "briefSummary": "The rationale of the current study is that the addition of intraperitoneal irinotecan (75 mg) to palliative systemic therapy is feasible and safe, and might result in an increased overall and progression free survival in patients with unresectable colorectal peritoneal metastases. The primary objectives are to explore the overall survival for the addition of intraperitoneal irinotecan (75 mg) to palliative systemic therapy in patients with unresectable colorectal peritoneal metastases. Secondary objectives are to assess the progression-free survival, toxicity profile, patient reported outcomes, costs, tumor response during trial treatment, and the systemic and intraperitoneal pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and SN-38. This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II study and patients will receive intraperitoneal irinotecan (75 mg) in combination with modified FOLFOX4 + bevacizumab."

Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state.The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.
