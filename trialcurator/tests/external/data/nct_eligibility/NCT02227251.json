Participants who were considered ineligible for standard multi-agent immunochemotherapy must have received at least 2 and no more than 5 prior treatment regimens including at least 1 course of anti-CD20 antibodies and must be approved by the Medical Monitor. Prior stem cell transplantation is allowed; induction, consolidation, stem cell collection, preparative regimen and transplantation ± maintenance are considered a single line of therapy.\n* Female participants of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and agree to use reliable methods of contraception for 3 months after their last dose of medication.
